Americana Foods POS & Surveillance Analysis
Overview
During my internship at Americana Foods (May 2024 â€“ June 2024), I worked on developing Python scripts and APIs to analyze POS machines and surveillance cameras, aiming to reduce theft and fraud across restaurant chains.

My contributions included:

Investigating and analyzing fraud cases such as voids, discounts, and cancellations by matching bill transactions using Python, CSV processing, and hyperlinking for improved data accuracy.
Developing automated data pipelines using MySQL Workbench to create local databases, significantly reducing processing time for data transfer.
Concatenating multiple video files to generate updated surveillance footage for fraud detection and Drive-Through Speed of Service analytics.
Publishing the final application on an Amazon EC2 instance for scalable deployment.
This project helped improve data integrity and provided actionable insights into transaction patterns, enhancing security and efficiency across the restaurant chain.
